The result of each child is subjective to them and as such their teachers would then know how to best approach educating that child and what to\r\nimprove based on the results generated from the FunQ system. Accurate evaluation ofthe cognitive skills are vital to the success of our software as this is critical for us to\r\nunderstand how a child learns as well as how best to improve them.\r\n\r\n**Verbal** intelligence measures the childâ€™s capacity to use language in order to express\r\nthemselves, it is how they interpret what is given to them as well as how efficiently they\r\ncan understand other people.\r\n\r\n**Visual** intelligence measures the ability to process visual material and to employ both\r\nphysical and mental images in thinking.Visualization also facilitates the ability to form\r\nassociations between pieces of information something which helps improve long term\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n**Logical-thinking** is the ability to make deductions that lead rationally to a certain\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n**Pattern recognition** is the ability to see order in a chaotic environment.\r\n\r\n**Classification** measures the ability to organize collections of items by finding\r\nsimilarities and differences between them. These skills enable the student to interpret\r\nrelevant data and gain a better general understanding of the world.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n---\r\n\r\nFunQ System has several dependencies that are essential to running the system.\r\nFollow the steps to setup the system.\r\n- Ensure [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) installed on your system. If  not follow the instructions to install composer at \r\n   \r\n  https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md\r\n\r\n- Copy the system to your server web directory\r\n\r\n  **On Windows**\r\n  \r\n   **_c:/www/_**\r\n  \r\n  **On Linux**\r\n  \r\n  **_/var/www/html_**\r\n\r\n- navigate to the application directory and run \r\n\r\n\t**composer update**\r\n\t\r\nThis should install the relevant components the system requires\r\n\r\n- You will be prompted to enter your database configuration\r\ndo so accordingly. If you choose not too, you can add the configuration in the \r\n**_app/config/parameters.yml_** file at any time\r\n\r\nHow To Run FunQ\r\n---\r\n\r\nFun Q was developed on the symfony php framework many of the systems features can be modified. \r\nInteracting with the system is the same process with many symfony2 applications.\r\nTo start the application\r\n\r\n - navigate to the *root* of the application folder\r\n - use this command to start the application server\r\n \r\n \t\tapp/console server:run\r\n\r\n This server will prompt the ip address and port number on which it is hosting\r\n - open your browser and navigate to the server\r\n \r\n \t*example:* **http://localhost:8000/**\r\n\r\n - The FunQ homepage should become available\r\n - The default administrator login is:\r\n \r\n \t**admin : admin123**\r\n\r\n - Once logged in you have access to all the system features.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n---\r\n\r\n  The FunQ system has been in development for 22 days and is currently still in the development. As a result\r\n  some of the systems features have yet to be fine tuned, however many of the basic features are operational.\r\n  The follwing features will cause problems when being accessed.\r\n  \r\n - User Create Page (user roles causing an issue)\r\n - Document Uploads and Edit Page (all documents retain the extension 'initial' regardless of document type)\r\n - The Quiz component\r\n - Downloading template to PDF (Images may not appear on document)\r\n These features are currently being developed and debugged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n######A Symfony project created on July 22, 2015, 2:13 pm.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
