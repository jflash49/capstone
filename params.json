The result of each child is subjective to them and as such their teachers would then know how to best approach educating that child and what to\r\nimprove based on the results generated from the FunQ system. Accurate evaluation ofthe cognitive skills are vital to the success of our software as this is critical for us to\r\nunderstand how a child learns as well as how best to improve them.\r\n\r\n**Verbal** intelligence measures the child’s capacity to use language in order to express\r\nthemselves, it is how they interpret what is given to them as well as how efficiently they\r\ncan understand other people.\r\n\r\n**Visual** intelligence measures the ability to process visual material and to employ both\r\nphysical and mental images in thinking.Visualization also facilitates the ability to form\r\nassociations between pieces of information something which helps improve long term\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n**Logical-thinking** is the ability to make deductions that lead rationally to a certain\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n**Pattern recognition** is the ability to see order in a chaotic environment.\r\n\r\n**Classification** measures the ability to organize collections of items by finding\r\nsimilarities and differences between them. These skills enable the student to interpret\r\nrelevant data and gain a better general understanding of the world.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
