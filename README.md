**What is FunQ?**
===
 FunQ is a student evaluation system developed to compliment the Jamaican Grade 4 literacy and numeracy examination. -
 The FunQ System is an Intelligence Quotient that aims to cover more scope in the assessment of each child, namely their verbal, spatial, visualization, classification, logic
and pattern recognition skills. The result of each child is subjective to them and as such their teachers would then know how to best approach educating that child and what to
improve based on the results generated from the FunQ system. Accurate evaluation ofthe cognitive skills are vital to the success of our software as this is critical for us to
understand how a child learns as well as how best to improve them.

**Verbal** intelligence measures the childâ€™s capacity to use language in order to express
themselves, it is how they interpret what is given to them as well as how efficiently they
can understand other people.

**Visual** intelligence measures the ability to process visual material and to employ both
physical and mental images in thinking.Visualization also facilitates the ability to form
associations between pieces of information something which helps improve long term
memory.

**Logical-thinking** is the ability to make deductions that lead rationally to a certain
conclusion.

**Pattern recognition** is the ability to see order in a chaotic environment.

**Classification** measures the ability to organize collections of items by finding
similarities and differences between them. These skills enable the student to interpret
relevant data and gain a better general understanding of the world.
